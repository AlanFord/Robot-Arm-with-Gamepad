Software to Control a MeArm with a Logitech F310 Gamepad

## Background
I have a MeArm V0.4 Pocket Sized Robot Arm.  While it's been on the shelf for a while, I'm finally going to complete 
it.  Originally it was going to be controlled with an Arduino UNO and a couple of minature joysticks on a custom 
Arduino shield.  However, a few years have gone by and I now have a Logitech gamepad and an Arduino USB
Host Shield.  The goal is now to use the gamepad to control the MeArm.

## Logitech F310 Driver
The driver software for using the Logitech F310 gamepad with the Arduino USB Host Shield can be found
here:  https://github.com/AlanFord/Logitech_F310_and_Arduino  The example INO file will be replaced with an 
Arduino sketch that uses the lf310.cpp and lf310.h files.
